    <h1 class="heading1">Why is Henry Cavill leaving The Witcher after season 3?
    </h1>
    <p class="article1">The Witcher spoilers follow, but they're minor.

      Ever since Henry Cavill was first cast as Geralt of Rivia, he's talked time and time again of his love for all
      things Witcher.

      "I really enjoy playing these kind of games and reading these kinds of books in my spare time," he said as far
      back as 2019 (via Hobby Consolas). "I don't consider it a job," Cavill continued. "For me it is more like an
      extraordinary opportunity to live my childhood and adult life fantasies."

      And that's why it's come as such a shock that Henry will no longer be involved with the show beyond season three.
      It's time to stop tossing those coins to Cavill, because on October 29, 2022, Netflix revealed that Geralt has
      been recast for season four with Liam Hemsworth (The Hunger Games) now set to star as the titular White Wolf.

      In an official statement following this big reveal, our new Geralt said he's "over the moon" about the opportunity
      to play him. That's lovely, but a lot of fans have already made it clear they're not happy with this change.

      As Liam himself said, he has "some big boots to fill", and for most viewers, it's impossible right now to imagine
      anyone other than Cavill in the role.

      Regardless of what you think of the show, one thing The Witcher fans all seemed to agree on is that Henry is the
      Witcher, perfectly embodying the Geralt of their dreams from the books and games alike.</p>



    <h1 class="heading2">Did Henry Cavill leave The Witcher because of Superman?</h1>
    <p class="article2">
      According to Deadline, where the news first broke, sources claim that Cavill had only made a "short-term deal" for
      The Witcher. After three seasons, it was simply time to move on. And that's thanks in large part to a hefty
      production schedule where he needed to juggle lots of other big projects. Those same sources also suggest that
      Henry's Witcher co-stars also renegotiated their contracts heading into season four as well.

      Upon hearing the news, most fans immediately figured that Henry Cavill's exit from The Witcher might have
      something to do with his other signature role. Yep, you know the one.

      And to be fair, the timing of this announcement was curious. During the same week as this reveal, Henry returned
      as Superman in the mid-credits scene for Black Adam. It wasn't a long cameo in terms of screentime, but its impact
      can't be overstated.
